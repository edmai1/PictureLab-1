# PictureLab
Modify the files and complete each of the activities in the student guide. For questions in Activities 1, 2, 3, and 7, write your answers in the AnswerQuestions.txt file. Complete all the exercises. 

### How to run each activity
To run each activity, you need to select the corresponding Run command from the drop-down menu next to the green Run button. For example, to run PictureTester, you need to select Run PictureTester.java. Then view the GUI using the View Desktop button at the top right of the console. You may find it easier to view the desktop in another browser tab; you can do this by clicking on the popout icon for Open Desktop in a New Tab.

To reset your console for running another activity, click the Stop button at the top of the Coding Rooms workspace.
